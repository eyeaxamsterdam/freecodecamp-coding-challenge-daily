/*
LCM
Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, given 4 and 6, return 12 because:

Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12 and so on.
Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18 and so on.
12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

function lcm(a, b) {
  let low = a;
  let high = b;

  while (low !== high) {
    if (low < high) {
      low += a;
    } else {
      high += b;
    }
  }

  return low;
}

//Tests
lcm(4, 6) //should return 12.
lcm(9, 6) //should return 18.
lcm(10, 100) //should return 100.
lcm(13, 17) //should return 221.
lcm(45, 70) //should return 630.
